# Outdoorsy-Task

Welcome to the Outdoorsy task! This repository contains a simple application that allows users to search for RV rentals and view their details.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/<username>/outdoorsy-task.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory by running `cd outdoorsy-task`
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` to view the application

## Running Tests

To run the test suite, simply run `npm test` from the project directory.

## Additional Features

If I had more time, I would consider adding the following features:

- Adding a map to display the location of the RV rentals
- Fixing any bugs related to the rendering and styling of the application (Currently there's a pesky bug that breaks styles sometimes, due to the style of rendering conflicting with the way styled components work)
- Reorganizing the file structure for better organization
- Adding more unit tests for better coverage
- Using a library to handle the fetching of data for the RV rentals
